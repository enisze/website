    As a software engineer and project manager, I have gained a diverse set of
    skills through my academic and professional experiences.
    <br />
    <br />
    I studied computer science at the RWTH in Aachen and during my studies, I
    explored various areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence,
    and data science, where I worked with programming languages like Python.
    <br />
    <br />
    My bachelor thesis focused on generative development, while my master's
    thesis centered on rdf schema generation for specific models.
    <br />
    <br />
    After completing my studies, I decided to pursue web application development
    and mobile app development, which is the area I currently work in.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have focused on developing skills in React, TypeScript, and Next.js, but I
    am always excited to learn new technologies and take on the challenges of
    unknown areas.
    <br />
    <br />
    Throughout my professional journey, I have gained valuable leadership
    skills, and I am passionate about working in teams.
    <br />
    <br />
    I believe that effective communication, collaboration, and adaptability are
    the keys to successful project management.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are interested in discussing any potential projects or opportunities,
    please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always open to new and exciting
