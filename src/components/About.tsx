    As a software engineer and project manager, I have developed a broad skill
    set through my education and professional experience.
    <br />
    <br />
    I studied computer science at RWTH Aachen, focusing on machine learning, AI,
    and data science with Python. My theses involved generative development and
    RDF schema generation.
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently, I work in web and mobile app development, specializing in React,
    TypeScript, and Next.js. I enjoy learning new technologies and tackling
    challenging projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have strong leadership skills and thrive in team environments, believing
    that effective communication and adaptability are key to successful project
    management.
    <br />
    <br />
    Feel free to contact me to discuss potential projects or opportunities. I'm
    always open to exciting new ventures.
