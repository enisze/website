    As a software engineer and project manager, I have gained a diverse set of
    skills through my academic and professional experiences. I studied computer
    science in Aachen and during my studies, I explored various areas such as
    machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science, where I worked
    with programming languages like Python. My bachelor thesis focused on
    generative development, while my master's thesis centered on rdf schema
    generation for specific models. After completing my studies, I decided to
    pursue web application development and mobile app development, which is the
    area I currently work in. I have focused on developing skills in React,
    TypeScript, and Next.js, but I am always excited to learn new technologies
    and take on the challenges of unknown areas. Throughout my professional
    journey, I have gained valuable leadership skills, and I am passionate about
    working in teams. I believe that effective communication, collaboration, and
    adaptability are the keys to successful project management. If you are
    interested in discussing any potential projects or opportunities, please do
    not hesitate to contact me. I am always open to new and exciting ventures
    that challenge me to grow as a software engineer and project manager.
